The standing stones were installed
in September 2020. We chose them
straight from the quarry at
Marnhull Stone near Sturminster
Newton.
The stone is from the Corallian
group of limestones which are
about 160 million years old and they
were deposited during the Jurassic
period between 145 and 201 million
years ago, when the sea level was
retreating!
The stones arrived on an
articulated lorry
At least a third of each
stone is underground
They were installed by our
wonderful digger man,
Kevin Holt
