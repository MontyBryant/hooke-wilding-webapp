Wild Bees & Birds
These bird boxes were built for swifts but we think
they are too low - and the swifts wouldn’t have liked
the creeper either.  The first occupants were starlings,
but the bees usurped them - European honey bees
(Apis mellifera).
However, one rather brave or foolish starling returned
this year and made his or her nest in one of the holes
between the bees.  It wasn’t a great success as the
bird died - presumably killed by the bees.
I love it when they form clusters like in the photo.  At
times we could see honey seeping through the wood.  I
think that the swift boxes are a bit small for all the
bees that want to live there, but they don’t seem
deterred!
