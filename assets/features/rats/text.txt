We think this is a rat hole!!
We’re delighted to find that we have rat holes
around our garden - and embrace them.  They play
a crucial role in our eco-system for example by:
“Why do we want certain animals around us and not
other animals? In new build homes, facilities are made in
the cavity to provide bats with a home. At the same time,
rats are controlled with clamps, glue plates and poision.”
 Scavenging:  Rats help clean up by
scavenging and consuming waste carrion
which can reduce the spread of disease.
Seed dispersal:  They can help with plant
propagation by spreading seeds.
Being prey:  They serve as a food source for
many predators such as snakes, owls and
other birds of prey, such as buzzards and red
kites.
