We were very proud of our beautiful
bat egg. Built from waste stone to
house a few different bat species
with a specal cave inside.
But I think the bats knew more than
we did - they visited but never
settled. And then the egg collapsed,
first on one side and then the other,
in the past year.
We are not planning to rebuild it but
let it become a glorious ruin covered
in wild flowers.
Stone carver, Tom Clark,built the bat
egg, finishing in December 2021.

Be Careful - it’s not
safe. Please don’t
go close to it!!!
The Bat Egg
has collapsed!
Pipistrelle bats weigh between 3.5
and 8.5 grams, but can eat up to
3,000 insects in a single night!
They may be living in the crevices
of the bat egg.
