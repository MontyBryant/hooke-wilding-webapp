You may have noticed these piles of stone
around the site - they're insect cairns. We
use them as markers for the butterfly
transept. They're made from waste stone
dug up from our yard.
INSECT APOCALYPSE
 Please read 'Silent Earth' -
it's a revelation about the
plight of insects and why
we need to be concerned
about them.
LEARNING ABOUT INSECTS
Remember that insects are a vital ingredient in the web
of life. They are food for birds and fish, which are, of
course, in decline too.
The brilliant thing about our wilding project is that
insects love it - and I love them.
In part, my interest was sparked by Dave Goulson, author
of numerous books about insects. He explained that
there has been a devastating decline in insects over the
last 100 years.
INSECT HOMES:
I've become fascinated by insects and have seen lots
of different types at Hooke Farm - many of which I
didn't know existed.
