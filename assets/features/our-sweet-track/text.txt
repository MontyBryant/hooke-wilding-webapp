Our Sweet Track
A ‘Sweet Track’ is a Neolithic timber walkway
and was originally part of a network of tracks
built to provide a dry path across marshy
ground. The trees were cut using stone and
flint axes making planks from oak, ash and
lime, whereas the poles were made with hazel
& alder.  The track found by Ray Sweet was
preserved in the peat bog and it was thought
to date back to around 3800 BC!
Our Sweet track is made from
sweet chestnut stakes and oak
planks.
The idea for its installation came
from Andrew George, from Wessex
Wilding.  It was constructed by a
small team headed by Joe Wood -
in the early stages helped by
Jasper Rayner and later by Bertie
Clark. They’ve all been involved in
a number of projects at Hooke
