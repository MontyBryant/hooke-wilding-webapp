It's an underground home that
amphibians and reptiles use
throughout winter to protect
themselves from the cold.
There are lots of frogs, toads and
newts in or near our ponds. They
love the boggy ground and sunny
spots.  By creating a hibernaculum
we have provided a safe space for
them to hibernate over winter.
HOW WE CREATED THE HIBERNACULUM
We lifted an area of turf about 1
by 2 metres and dug out the soil
at a depth of 50cm
We used old tiles to create entrance
tunnels into the centre
We then filled the hole with rocks &
logs to create crawl spaces
We covered this with loose soil and the
original turf was laid on top
We made sure the entrance tunnels were
accessible
As the logs decompose
they release heat
warming  the
hibernaculum and
making it an ideal
hibernation habitat for
amphibians & reptiles

It was inspired and built by

here helping with land
management since 2021.
