MOUNT SCOTLAND
My husband, Jamie Macdonald, is proud of his
Scottish heritage so we decided to dedicate this
mound to him.  It includes 3 Scot's Pine trees and 2
driftwood stags.  The stags were bought in
Bridport market and made from driftwood which
originated in Indonesia - sadly, as a result of the
horrendous deforestation  However the wood
was drifting for some time before being made into
sculptures, which makes them very resilient to
the weather.  The antlers were provided by Jamie
