They are food for birds and fish, which are, of\ncourse, in decline too.\nThe brilliant thing about our wilding project is that\ninsects love it - and I love them.\nIn part, my interest was sparked by Dave Goulson, author\nof numerous books about insects. He explained that\nthere has been a devastating decline in insects over the\nlast 100 years.\nINSECT HOMES:\nI've become fascinated by insects and have seen lots\nof different types at Hooke Farm - many of which I\ndidn't know existed.",
